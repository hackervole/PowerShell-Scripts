# Random PowerShell Scripts

## Shuffle Wallpapers

A script that randomly sets the desktop wallpaper from a folder of wallpapers. Written because the Windows 10 "Folder" option for wallpapers selects different wallpapers for each display.

Usage:
- Set the `WALLPAPER_DIR` environment variable to a directory containing multiple wallpaper images
- Run the script manually or via Task Scheduler
